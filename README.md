# Build-RAG-Agent-with-LLM

## Introduction

This repository contains the implementation of a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) agent using Large Language Models (LLMs). RAG agents combine the power of information retrieval with text generation, enabling applications such as intelligent question-answering systems, conversational agents, and more.

If you're interested in a detailed, step-by-step explanation of how this project was built, including code walkthroughs and in-depth analysis, check out my [Medium blog post- "Build RAG Agents using LLMs: Step-by-step Guide" By Sree Deekshitha Yerra](https://blog.gopenai.com/building-rag-agents-using-llms-step-by-step-guide-dfe1bfe0bf54). 

## Features

- **Retrieval Component**: Efficiently retrieves relevant information from a large corpus.
- **Generation Component**: Generates context-aware responses using a fine-tuned LLM.
- **Ranking Component**: Ranks generated responses to select the most relevant one.
- **Training and Fine-Tuning**: Easily fine-tune pre-trained LLMs for your specific use case.
- **Deployment Ready**: Integrate the RAG agent into your applications for practical use.

## Install the dependencies

```bash
    git clone https://github.com/SreeEswaran/Build-RAG-Agent-with-LLM.git
    cd Build-RAG-Agent-with-LLM
    pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. Run the RAG Agent
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
2. Finetune the model
   ```bash
   python src/training.py
   ```
